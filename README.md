# Pollutant Emissions Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting future industrial pollutant emissions using historical environmental data.  
The goal is to support environmental planning and regulation efforts by predicting emissions trends across industries.

## Project Overview
- **Problem Statement:** Predict future pollutant emission levels based on past industrial data.
- **Approach:** Time series analysis and regression modeling to capture emission trends.
- **Outcome:** Developed models that forecast pollutant outputs to aid decision-making for environmental management.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Time Series Analysis Techniques
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, formatting time features)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (identifying emission patterns and key drivers)
3. Feature Engineering (creating trend indicators and time lags)
4. Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Time Series Models)
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, RÂ² Score)
6. Visualization of actual vs forecasted pollutant levels

## Project Files
- `NPRI_Python_file.ipynb`: Full analysis, modeling, and visualization notebook.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate seasonality and external factors (e.g., weather data) to enhance forecasting.
- Explore deep learning models like LSTM for better time series predictions.
